This is mostly me playing around with what I've learned, for the purpose of testing/ expanding my knowledge. A friend is a brilliant cook and stay-at-home mom. I told her that if she wanted to start a meal service (primarily to feed ME, while I study, I would create w ebsite for her business. This is my first attempt. It's still entirely basic, and yet, creating it helped contextulaize the bit of learning I have so far. Real-world examples, especially ones that have real-world emotion/ drive tied to them, really create an incentive to explore classroom knowledge!
